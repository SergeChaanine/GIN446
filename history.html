      <section>
         <p>The World Wide Web has undergone an astounding development since its creation in the late 1980s and early
            1990s. As a tool for sharing scientific documents, the web has grown into a humongous platform that fuels
            communication, commerce, entertainment, and thousands of digital services. It can be traced through various
            phases of evolution with the advent of technological innovations and shifts in user expectations.</p>

         <h3>1. Static Web</h3>
         <p>The first ten years of the web were dominated by static HTML pages. They were plain documents made up of
            text, hyperlinks, and occasionally pictures. Sites were generally informative, having the visual appearance
            and feel of online brochures rather than interactive websites. Tim Berners-Lee's creation of HTML, HTTP, and
            the first web server gave the foundation for linking documents worldwide. Browsers such as NCSA Mosaic and
            later Netscape Navigator made it possible for those without technical skills to access this new medium.
            While new, the static web was limited. Pages could not be edited, and personalization or interaction was
            nonexistent in nature.</p>

         <h3>2. Dynamic & Interactive Web</h3>
         <p>As demand for greater richness of experience grew, developers began to experiment with the limits of static
            pages. Technologies such as CGI scripts, server-side programming (PHP, ASP, JSP), and databases allowed for
            dynamic generation of content. Instead of sending the same page to everyone, websites can now respond to
            user input, like sending different search results, handling e-commerce transactions, or handling user
            accounts. JavaScript and later Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) made it possible to build more
            interactive applications where the user interface of parts of a webpage could be dynamically updated without
            reloading the entire page. This era developed web-based email, social networking websites, and online
            shopping websites, changing how people interacted with the web.</p>

         <h3>3. Mobile & Responsive Web</h3>
         <p>The introduction of the smartphone changed the web in a core manner. Small screens, touch interfaces, and
            unpredictable network conditions forced developers to rethink design and performance. Words like responsive
            web design, which changes layouts depending on screen size, became a requirement. Mobile-first development
            ensured that websites were accessible and usable on a wide range of devices. Simultaneously, faster wireless
            networks and better browsers made seamless multimedia experience possible, ranging from streaming video to
            conducting online banking. During this era, the web transitioned from being a desktop-centric medium to
            becoming accessible at all times and places.</p>

      <section>
         <h3>4. Component & API-driven Web</h3>
         <p>Modern web apps do much more than display content; they're complex platforms powered by JavaScript
            frameworks (React, Angular, Vue), APIs, and microservices. Apps like Google Docs, Slack, or Spotify compete
            on both user experience and functionality with native desktop applications. Developers don't build
            monolithic codebases; instead, they produce modular, component-based systems that are easier to scale and
            maintain. APIs unlock connections between web applications and third-party applications, cloud services, and
            large datasets, all of which plug in conveniently together. It results in a highly interactive, data-led
            experience that can support everything from collaboration in real-time to rich gaming experiences.</p>
