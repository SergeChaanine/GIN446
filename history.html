      <section>
         <p>The World Wide Web began as a system for sharing scientific documents in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
            Early milestones included Tim Berners-Lee's invention of HTML, HTTP, and the first web server, followed by
            the first graphical browser that made the Web visible to many people. As the Web expanded, browser
            innovations and standardization efforts by the W3C shaped the platform and enabled richer content.</p>

         <h3>Key phases</h3>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Static Web:</strong> Plain HTML documents with hyperlinks â€” the 1990s.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic &amp; Interactive Web:</strong> CGI, server-side scripting, then Ajax and single-page
               apps in the 2000s.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile &amp; Responsive Web:</strong> Mobile devices changed design priorities and performance
               considerations.</li>
            <li><strong>Component &amp; API-driven Web:</strong> Modern apps rely on JavaScript frameworks, APIs, and
               microservices.</li>
         </ol>

         <h3>Trends and the near future</h3>
         <p>Current trends emphasize performance, privacy, openness, and progressive enhancement. Standards continue to
            evolve (for example, improvements to image formats, web components, and privacy-preserving APIs). The Web's
            future will likely blend richer offline capabilities, tighter privacy controls, and more powerful
            browser-native APIs that reduce dependence on proprietary plugins.</p>
