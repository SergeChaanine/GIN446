          <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
          <p>
            The World Wide Web has undergone an astounding development since its
            creation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As a tool for sharing
            scientific documents, the web has grown into a humongous platform
            that fuels communication, commerce, entertainment, and thousands of
            digital services. It can be traced through various phases of
            evolution with the advent of technological innovations and shifts in
            user expectations.

          <h3>1. Static Web</h3>
          <p>
            The first ten years of the web were dominated by static HTML pages.
            They were plain documents made up of text, hyperlinks, and
            occasionally pictures. Sites were generally informative, having the
            visual appearance and feel of online brochures rather than
            interactive websites. Tim Berners-Lee's creation of HTML, HTTP, and
            the first web server gave the foundation for linking documents
            worldwide. Browsers such as NCSA Mosaic and later Netscape Navigator
            made it possible for those without technical skills to access this
            new medium. While new, the static web was limited. Pages could not
            be edited, and personalization or interaction was nonexistent in
            nature.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Dynamic &amp; Interactive Web</h3>
          <p>
            As demand for greater richness of experience grew, developers began
            to experiment with the limits of static pages. Technologies such as
            CGI scripts, server-side programming (PHP, ASP, JSP), and databases
            allowed for dynamic generation of content. Instead of sending the
            same page to everyone, websites can now respond to user input, like
            sending different search results, handling e-commerce transactions,
            or handling user accounts. JavaScript and later Ajax (Asynchronous
            JavaScript and XML) made it possible to build more interactive
            applications where the user interface of parts of a webpage could be
            dynamically updated without reloading the entire page. This era
            developed web-based email, social networking websites, and online
            shopping websites, changing how people interacted with the web.

          <h3>3. Mobile &amp; Responsive Web</h3>
          <p>
            The introduction of the smartphone changed the web in a core manner.
            Small screens, touch interfaces, and unpredictable network
            conditions forced developers to rethink design and performance.
            Words like responsive web design, which changes layouts depending on
            screen size, became a requirement. Mobile-first development ensured
            that websites were accessible and usable on a wide range of devices.
            Simultaneously, faster wireless networks and better browsers made
            seamless multimedia experience possible, ranging from streaming
            video to conducting online banking. During this era, the web
            transitioned from being a desktop-centric medium to becoming
            accessible at all times and places.

          <h3>4. Component &amp; API-driven Web</h3>
          <p>
            Modern web apps do much more than display content; they're complex
            platforms powered by JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue),
            APIs, and microservices. Apps like Google Docs, Slack, or Spotify
            compete on both user experience and functionality with native
            desktop applications. Developers don't build monolithic codebases;
            instead, they produce modular, component-based systems that are
            easier to scale and maintain. APIs unlock connections between web
            applications and third-party applications, cloud services, and large
            datasets, all of which plug in conveniently together. It results in
            a highly interactive, data-led experience that can support
            everything from collaboration in real-time to rich gaming
            experiences.
