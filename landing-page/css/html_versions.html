          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) began in the early 1990s, created
            by Tim Berners-Lee as a simple language for sharing documents on the
            World Wide Web. Over the decades, HTML grew through multiple
            versions: HTML 2.0 standardized basic features, HTML 3.2 introduced
            tables and applets, and HTML 4.01 brought in stylesheets and
            scripting support. In the early 2000s, the development of XHTML
            attempted to make HTML more XML-compliant, but it was eventually set
            aside in favor of a more practical path forward: HTML5.

          <h2>The rise of HTML5</h2>
          <p>
            HTML5, finalized in 2014, was a major milestone. It introduced
            semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and
            &lt;footer&gt;, along with native support for video, audio, and
            canvas graphics. The goal was to provide richer, plugin-free
            experiences across devices and browsers. This version marked the
            rebirth of HTML as the central language of the web, with strong
            support from browser vendors and the developer community.

          <h2>HTML5.1 and 5.2 refinements</h2>
          <p>
            Following HTML5, incremental updates were released. HTML5.1 (2016)
            and HTML5.2 (2017) improved accessibility, security, and usability.
            They standardized features like &lt;dialog&gt;, responsive image
            attributes, and modern input types. These refinements addressed
            real-world needs and ensured the language stayed relevant in a
            rapidly evolving web ecosystem.

          <h2>After HTML 5.2: The Living Standard</h2>
          <p>
            After 5.2, the W3C stopped versioning HTML. Instead, the WHATWG
            group adopted a <strong>Living Standard</strong> approach. This
            means that HTML is now continuously updated, rather than being
            published as discrete versions. Developers no longer wait years for
            new versions; instead, features are added, clarified, or deprecated
            steadily as browser support evolves. Today, "HTML" refers to this
            ever-evolving standard that underpins the modern web.

          <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Evolutionary growth:</strong> HTML adapted over time to
              meet new needs like multimedia, scripting, and responsive design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community-driven:</strong> Browser vendors and developers
              actively shape the language through collaboration in the WHATWG
              group.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No more versions:</strong> The Living Standard ensures
              HTML remains up to date without waiting for the next "big"
              release.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus on interoperability:</strong> Changes prioritize
              consistency across browsers for developers and end users alike.
