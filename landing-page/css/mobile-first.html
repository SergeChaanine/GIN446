          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Mobile-First development is an approach that prioritizes the mobile
            user experience from the start: design and build for constrained
            screens, limited bandwidth, and touch interaction first, then scale
            up to larger screens. This mindset produces sites that are faster,
            more accessible, and focused on essential content. Google's
            mobile-first indexing means the mobile version of a page is used for
            indexing and ranking, so a mobile-first approach also supports
            discoverability in search engines.

          <h2>Why start with mobile?</h2>
          <p>
            There are three practical reasons to start with mobile. First, a
            large and growing share of global web traffic originates from mobile
            devices; designing for the smaller screen forces prioritization of
            content and interactions. Second, mobile-first encourages
            performance-first thinking: fewer and smaller assets, lower initial
            payloads, and simpler layouts. Third, mobile-first aligns with
            inclusive design, focusing on essential content and clear navigation
            helps people on limited bandwidth, older devices, or assistive
            technologies.

          <h2>Core principles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Content-first:</strong> Prioritize what the user needs
              most. Reduce non-essential UI chrome for small screens.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Progressive enhancement:</strong> Start with a reliable
              baseline experience that works without advanced features, then
              layer on enhancements for capable browsers and devices. This
              reduces breakage and improves accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance budget:</strong> Set and enforce a
              size/latency budget (images, fonts, and third-party scripts are
              common culprits).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Touch-first interactions:</strong> Design controls that
              are large enough for finger taps and spaced to prevent accidental
              activation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Test on real devices and networks:</strong> Emulators are
              useful, but real-device testing on slow networks reveals real user
              pain points.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Practical checklist</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Ensure the &lt;meta name="viewport"&gt; tag is present for proper
              scaling on mobile devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimize and serve appropriately sized images; prefer modern
              formats and lazy-loading strategies where appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimize third-party scripts and prioritize critical rendering
              path assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide clear, linear navigation and make link text descriptive
              for screen readers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Confirm content parity between mobile and desktop views to avoid
              search-indexing penalties.
            </li>
          </ol>
