         <p>Security on the Web covers threats that range from opportunistic phishing to sophisticated software
            supply-chain compromises. Threats affect everyone; users, small businesses, large platforms, and often
            exploit human factors as well as technical weaknesses.</p>

         <p>The internet has transformed communication, business, and daily life, but its openness also introduces
            risks.
            Individuals and organizations face threats ranging from phishing to ransomware. By understanding these risks
            and
            adopting safe practices, users can reduce exposure and safeguard digital assets.</p>

         <h2>Common Risks</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Deceptive emails and websites impersonating trusted sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Malware & Ransomware:</strong> Malicious programs that steal, spy, or lock data until payment is
               made.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Exposed databases leaking sensitive information for misuse.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Credentials:</strong> Simple or reused passwords enabling unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Wi-Fi Risks:</strong> Attackers intercept data on unsecured networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Psychological manipulation that exploits human trust.</li>
         </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
         <h2>Safe Practices</h2>
         <p>Before entering sensitive information into a website, look for the security padlock symbol. The padlock is
            one way of checking that a website is safe and indicates that the information you submit is secure.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Double-click the icon. It will display the certificate information for the page you are viewing to
               guarantee that you are on a safe, secure website. Make sure the certificate is current and issued to the
               same company you are visiting.</li>
            <li>Don’t be fooled by a padlock that appears on the web page itself because it is possible for a cyber
               criminal to copy the image. So, double check that the padlock is in the window frame of the browser
               itself.</li>
            <li>After validating the padlock, you can also check the text before the website name in the address bar.
               The “https” is another indication that the page you are viewing is secure.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the web address. Check the address and if you click on a link, look to make sure that
               the address stayed the same. If it has changed, then it has taken you to a fraudulent web address where
               cyber criminals can monitor and access your information.</li>
         </ul>
