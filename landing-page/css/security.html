          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Security on the Web covers threats that range from opportunistic
            phishing to sophisticated software supply-chain compromises. Threats
            affect everyone; users, small businesses, large platforms, and often
            exploit human factors as well as technical weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet has transformed communication, business, and daily
            life, but its openness also introduces risks. Individuals and
            organizations face threats ranging from phishing to ransomware. By
            understanding these risks and adopting safe practices, users can
            reduce exposure and safeguard digital assets.

          <h2>Common Risks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Phishing:</strong> Deceptive emails and websites
              impersonating trusted sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Malware & Ransomware:</strong> Malicious programs that
              steal, spy, or lock data until payment is made.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Exposed databases leaking
              sensitive information for misuse.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weak Credentials:</strong> Simple or reused passwords
              enabling unauthorized access.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public Wi-Fi Risks:</strong> Attackers intercept data on
              unsecured networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Psychological manipulation
              that exploits human trust.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Safe Practices</h2>
          <p>
            Before entering sensitive information into a website, look for the
            security padlock symbol. The padlock is one way of checking that a
            website is safe and indicates that the information you submit is
            secure.
          </p>

          <h3>How to verify website security:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Check the padlock icon:</strong> Double-click the icon. It
              will display the certificate information for the page you are
              viewing to guarantee that you are on a safe, secure website. Make
              sure the certificate is current and issued to the same company you
              are visiting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Beware of fake padlocks:</strong> Don't be fooled by a
              padlock that appears on the web page itself because it is possible
              for a cyber criminal to copy the image. So, double check that the
              padlock is in the window frame of the browser itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verify HTTPS:</strong> After validating the padlock, you
              can also check the text before the website name in the address
              bar. The "https" is another indication that the page you are
              viewing is secure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitor URL changes:</strong> Pay attention to the web
              address. Check the address and if you click on a link, look to
              make sure that the address stayed the same. If it has changed,
              then it has taken you to a fraudulent web address where cyber
              criminals can monitor and access your information.
            </li>
          </ul>
