         </header>

         <section>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced in 1996 as a way to separate content from presentation.
               Before CSS,
               web pages relied on HTML attributes like &lt;font&gt; and bgcolor, making
               designs
               hard to maintain. CSS brought flexibility, modularity, and control over how web pages look, and has since
               become an essential part of web development.</p>

         <section>
            <h3>Early CSS versions</h3>
            <p><strong>CSS1 (1996):</strong> Focused on basic styling: fonts, colors, margins, and simple selectors. It
               provided the foundation for consistent design across browsers.</p>
            <p><strong>CSS2 (1998):</strong> Expanded capabilities with positioning, media types, z-index, and advanced
               selectors. This version also introduced the concept of style for different devices (print vs. screen).
            </p>
            <p><strong>CSS2.1 (2011):</strong> A revision of CSS2, ironing out inconsistencies and better reflecting
               what
               browsers had actually implemented.</p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h3>The CSS3 era</h3>
            <p>Instead of a single monolithic specification, CSS3 was split into <strong>modules</strong>, each evolving
               at
               its own pace. Examples include the Flexbox module, Grid Layout, Transitions,
               Animations, and Media Queries. This modular approach allowed browsers to implement
               features
               faster and gave developers earlier access to modern styling tools.
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h3>CSS today: a Living Standard</h3>
            <p>Like HTML, CSS is now maintained as a <strong>Living Standard</strong> by the W3C and WHATWG communities.
               Instead of version numbers (like “CSS4”), the standard evolves continuously. Features such as
               container
               queries, subgrid, and nesting are examples of modern additions being adopted in
               browsers today.

            <h3>Understanding CSS rules, @-rules, and rulesets</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>CSS Rule:</strong> The basic building block of CSS. It can be a regular style rule (selector
                  +
                  declaration block) or an at-rule.</li>
               <br>
               <li><strong>Ruleset:</strong> A selector followed by a declaration block. Example:
                  <pre>p { color: blue; font-size: 16px; }</pre>
                  Here, p is the selector, and the declarations inside the braces form the ruleset.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li><strong>@-Rule:</strong> A special rule that starts with @ and gives instructions to the
                  CSS
                  processor. Examples include:
                  <ul>
                     <li>@import — to import external stylesheets.</li>
                     <li>@media — for responsive design, applying styles under certain conditions.</li>
                     <li>@font-face — to define custom fonts.</li>
                     <li>@keyframes — for animations.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </section>

            <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>CSS evolved from simple styling in CSS1 to powerful layout and animation systems in modern CSS
                  modules.</li>
               <li>The modular, Living Standard approach ensures faster updates and continuous improvements.</li>
               <li>Rules, rulesets, and @-rules are the foundation of CSS, enabling both simple styling and advanced
                  responsive, interactive design.</li>
            </ol>
