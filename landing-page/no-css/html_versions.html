            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) began in the early 1990s, created by Tim Berners-Lee as a simple
               language
               for sharing documents on the World Wide Web. Over the decades, HTML grew through multiple versions:
               HTML 2.0 standardized basic features, HTML 3.2 introduced tables and applets, and
               HTML 4.01 brought in stylesheets and scripting support. In the early 2000s, the development of
               XHTML attempted to make HTML more XML-compliant, but it was eventually set aside in favor of a more
               practical
               path forward: HTML5.

            <h3>The rise of HTML5</h3>
            <p>HTML5, finalized in 2014, was a major milestone. It introduced semantic elements like
               &lt;header&gt;,
               &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, along with native support for video,
               audio, and
               canvas graphics. The goal was to provide richer, plugin-free experiences across devices and browsers.
               This
               version marked the rebirth of HTML as the central language of the web, with strong support from browser
               vendors and the developer community.

            <h3>HTML5.1 and 5.2 refinements</h3>
            <p>Following HTML5, incremental updates were released. HTML5.1 (2016) and HTML5.2 (2017) improved
               accessibility,
               security, and usability. They standardized features like &lt;dialog&gt;, responsive image
               attributes, and modern input types. These refinements addressed real-world needs and ensured the language
               stayed relevant in a rapidly evolving web ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>After HTML 5.2: The Living Standard</h3>
            <p>After 5.2, the W3C stopped versioning HTML. Instead, the WHATWG group adopted a <strong>Living
                  Standard</strong>
               approach. This means that HTML is now continuously updated, rather than being published as discrete
               versions.
               Developers no longer wait years for new versions; instead, features are added, clarified, or deprecated
               steadily as browser support evolves. Today, “HTML” refers to this ever-evolving standard that underpins
               the
               modern web.</p>

            <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Evolutionary growth:</strong> HTML adapted over time to meet new needs like multimedia,
                  scripting,
                  and responsive design.</li>
               <li><strong>Community-driven:</strong> Browser vendors and developers actively shape the language through
                  collaboration in the WHATWG group.</li>
               <li><strong>No more versions:</strong> The Living Standard ensures HTML remains up to date without
                  waiting for
                  the next “big” release.</li>
               <li><strong>Focus on interoperability:</strong> Changes prioritize consistency across browsers for
                  developers
                  and end users alike.</li>
            </ul>
