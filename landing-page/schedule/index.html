            <h3>Innovation & Entrepreneurship for Engineers</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Code:</strong> GEN303 | <strong>Instructor:</strong> Dr.
              Nancy Saliba | <strong>Room:</strong> E203
            </p>
            <p>
              In all sectors, innovation and entrepreneurship (as a form of
              innovation) have become an important source of sustainable
              competitive advantage for firms around the world. However,
              innovation management and the capability of managers and owners to
              build innovative organization is quite a challenge. In this
              course, we will address the role of innovation and
              entrepreneurship for macro and micro levels and focus on practices
              and processes to successfully manage it. The course will focus on
              entrepreneurial firms (start-ups and corporate ventures of
              established firms) and analyze success and failure cases of
              innovation. This course provides good grounding in technology and
              innovation management for students interested in becoming
              entrepreneurs or managers in innovation driven firms. Students
              will learn based on lectures, case analysis, external experts and
              own research and presentations. In innovation management it is
              impossible to separate organizational strategy from implementation
              since a great idea will only become an innovation if managers are
              capable to commercialize and monetize it. Therefore, much of the
              material discussed and analyzed within the course relates to
              strategy and organizational behavior.

              The aim of this lab is the practical application of assembly
              language to program a microprocessor with hardware interfacing.
              Students begin by exploring the logical architecture of the Intel
              8086 processor using the development board and the corresponding
              software tool and code compiler. Physical architecture is then
              explored, while interfacing the processor with different
              Inputs/Outputs using the associated development board.

              The "Web Programming" course is a core requirement for Computer
              Engineering students and serves as a major elective for those
              majoring in Electrical, Telecommunications, or Biomedical
              Engineering. This course is designed to provide students with a
              comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side
              web programming, encompassing a wide range of essential
              technologies and skills. Throughout the course, students will
              delve into fundamental topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM
              (Document Object Model), PHP, and MySQL. These technologies form
              the building blocks of modern web development, enabling students
              to create interactive and dynamic web applications. Additionally,
              students will gain proficiency in XML and DTD (Document Type
              Definition) for structured data representation and exchange,
              further enhancing their web programming capabilities. By the end
              of this course, students will be well-versed in web development,
              equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to design, build,
              and maintain sophisticated web applications. Whether pursuing a
              career in computer engineering or related fields, this course
              provides a solid foundation for success in the digital world.
