        <p>Mobile-First development is an approach that prioritizes the mobile user experience from the start: design
          and build for constrained screens, limited bandwidth, and touch interaction first, then scale up to larger
          screens. This mindset produces sites that are faster, more accessible, and focused on essential content.
          Google’s mobile-first indexing means the mobile version of a page is used for indexing and ranking, so a
          mobile-first approach also supports discoverability in search engines (see References).</p>

        <h3>Why start with mobile?</h3>
        <p>There are three practical reasons to start with mobile. First, a large and growing share of global web
          traffic originates from mobile devices; designing for the smaller screen forces prioritization of content and
          interactions. Second, mobile-first encourages performance-first thinking: fewer and smaller assets, lower
          initial payloads, and simpler layouts. Third, mobile-first aligns with inclusive design — focusing on
          essential content and clear navigation helps people on limited bandwidth, older devices, or assistive
          technologies.</p>

        <h3>Core principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Content-first:</strong> Prioritize what the user needs most. Reduce non-essential UI chrome for
            small screens.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive enhancement:</strong> Start with a reliable baseline experience that works without
            advanced features, then layer on enhancements for capable browsers and devices. This reduces breakage and
            improves accessibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance budget:</strong> Set and enforce a size/latency budget (images, fonts, and third-party
            scripts are common culprits).</li>
          <li><strong>Touch-first interactions:</strong> Design controls that are large enough for finger taps and
            spaced to prevent accidental activation.</li>
          <li><strong>Test on real devices and networks:</strong> Emulators are useful, but real-device testing on slow
            networks reveals real user pain points.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Practical checklist</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Ensure the <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> tag is present for proper scaling on mobile devices.
          </li>
          <li>Optimize and serve appropriately sized images; prefer modern formats and lazy-loading strategies where
            appropriate.</li>
          <li>Minimize third-party scripts and prioritize critical rendering path assets.</li>
          <li>Provide clear, linear navigation and make link text descriptive for screen readers.</li>
          <li>Confirm content parity between mobile and desktop views to avoid search-indexing penalties.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <h3>Further reading & sources</h3>
        <p>Key industry guidance includes Google’s Mobile-First Indexing documentation and the GSMA State of Mobile
          Internet Connectivity report, which provide technical and market context for mobile-first strategies. For
          standards and responsive techniques, consult W3C and web.dev resources (see References).</p>
