      <p>The table below summarizes recent public estimates for internet adoption and measured speeds in Lebanon and the
        wider Middle East. Sources and full references are listed on the References page. Note that different
        organizations use different methods (surveys, network tests, administrative records), so values can vary by
        source and date.</p>

        <h3>How to read these numbers</h3>
        <p>DataReportal (Kepios) aggregates platform and survey data and reports country-level internet user estimates,
          while the World Bank/ITU provide development indicators often based on national surveys and administrative
          data. Speedtest (Ookla) measures network performance via active tests and reports median download speeds;
          these are useful for comparing measured user experience but depend on where and when tests were run. The
          References page provides direct links to the cited datasets.</p>

        <h3>Trends and context</h3>
        <p>Lebanon has seen rapid growth in internet adoption over the past decade, reaching over 90% of the population
          by early 2024 according to DataReportal. However, economic challenges and infrastructure issues have affected
          service quality and affordability. In the broader Middle East, there is a wide disparity between high-income
          Gulf states with near-universal access and fast networks, and lower-income countries where adoption and
          speeds lag behind global averages. Continued investment in infrastructure, regulatory reforms, and digital
          literacy programs are key to improving access and quality across the region.</p>
