      <p>The table below summarizes recent public estimates for internet adoption and measured speeds in Lebanon and the wider Middle East. Sources and full references are listed on the References page. Note that different organizations use different methods (surveys, network tests, administrative records), so values can vary by source and date.</p>

      <table border="1">
        <caption>Selected Internet indicators for Lebanon and regional context (latest available public estimates).</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Region / Country</th>
            <th scope="col">Internet users (% of population)</th>

            <th scope="row">Lebanon</th>
            <td>90.1% (DataReportal, Jan 2024) — World Bank reports ~83–84% (2023).</td>
            <td>~4.76 million (DataReportal, Jan 2024)</td>
            <td>Measured speeds and rank vary by month and dataset; fixed and mobile medians are lower than Gulf leaders (see Ookla Speedtest Global Index for country ranks).</td>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Middle East (selected)</th>
            <td>Varies greatly by country; high-income Gulf states typically report near-universal access while lower-income countries lag.</td>
            <td>Millions of users per country; regional totals depend on inclusion criteria (see ITU and DataReportal).</td>
            <td>Some Gulf states rank among the global fastest for mobile and fixed median speeds; others are much lower — see Speedtest Global Index.</td>

        <h3>How to read these numbers</h3>
        <p>DataReportal (Kepios) aggregates platform and survey data and reports country-level internet user estimates, while the World Bank/ITU provide development indicators often based on national surveys and administrative data. Speedtest (Ookla) measures network performance via active tests and reports median download speeds; these are useful for comparing measured user experience but depend on where and when tests were run. The References page provides direct links to the cited datasets.</p>
